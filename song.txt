I'm holding on so tightly now
My insides scream so loud
They keep watching, watching me drown
How did it come to this?
How did it come to this? How did I know it was you?
It was a bad dream asphyxiated, watch me bleed
The life support was cut, the knot was too tight
They push and pull me, but they know they'll never win

Throw it all away, throw it all away
I keep on screaming, but there's really nothing left to say
So get away, just get away
I keep on fighting, but I can't keep going on this way

I can't keep going, can't keep going on like this
They make me sick, and I get so sick of it
'Cause they won't let me, they won't let me breathe
Why can't they let me be?
Why can't they let me be? Why don't I know what I am?
I force this hate into my heart 'cause it's my only friend
My lips are sewn shut, I watch myself bleed
They push and pull me, and it's killing me within
